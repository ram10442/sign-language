# Project Description

To run the software, extract the `Pro.rar` archive and execute the `Pro.exe` file. Before use, please make sure to watch the test video provided for proper guidance.

### Python Code for the Executable File:
- **Main Executable**: `Pro.exe`
- **Training Code**: `train_svm`
- **Data Collection Code (One Hand)**: `distance_recorder_one_hand`
- **Data Collection Code (Two Hands)**: `distance_recorder_two_hand`

The software allows you to gather data for both one-hand and two-hand movements. The following scripts are involved:

1. **`distance_recorder_one_hand`**: Collects data for one-hand gestures.
2. **`distance_recorder_two_hand`**: Collects data for two-hand gestures.
3. **`train_svm`**: Used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model based on the collected data.

Please follow the instructions and watch the test video before starting the application to ensure proper setup and usage.
